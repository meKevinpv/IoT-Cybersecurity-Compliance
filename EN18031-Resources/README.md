## Technical Documentation Workflow for EN18031-1 ACM AUM <a name='EN180311ACMAUM'></a>

### Description
We often hear IoT manufacturers asking how to identify applicable requirements of EN18031 standards? Even after reading the whole standards, they still wonder "what is applicable to my device?"
 
Are you also an IoT manufacturer with the same question? To help you get started and identify applicable requirements, we created this workflow covering the first 2 mechanisms of EN18031, Access Control Mechanisms (ACM) and Authentication Mechanisms (AUM).

### Objectives
This workflow enables you to:
1. Identify the 𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘁𝘀 to be protected by access control
2. Identify the applicable requirements concerning the 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹 𝗺𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗺𝘀 needed to protect these assets
3. Identify the applicable requirements concerning the 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗺𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗺𝘀 needed by these access control mechanisms

At each step, the workflow also indicates what information needs to be captured in your Technical Documentation. In case you have not started your Technical Documentation, you can use our template available in this repo.

### Key take-aways
1. It all starts with the assets: You need to identify and classify your assets in order to apply the right requirements.
2. You cannot scope upfront: As depicted in the workflow, the identification of applicable requirements calls for multiple iterations over the standard.
3. Everything needs to be documented: Even when a requirement is not applicable, you still need to document and justify why it is not so.

### How to use the workflow

1. Download our Technical Documentation Template
2. Identify your security and network assets
   - You can list them in the template worksheets "Overview-SecAssets" and "Overview-NetAssets". For each, indicate its type (column B), whether it is sensitive or confidential (column C) and provide a description (column D).
3. Go through the workflow from top to bottom, while iterating as many times as needed to cover all your assets/mechanisms.
   - Whenever you reach numbers (in black circles), you need to refer to the designated box on the right side and document accordingly.
   

### Note
In line with the standard, the workflow assumes that the assets are already identified. If you need help with their identification, you can contact us.
